Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

<!-- **About** -->

<!-- <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p> -->


I am a Research Fellow at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in MMLab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with [Xiaogang Wang](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/). I was a Director of R&D at Intelligent Automotive Group of [SenseTime Group Inc.](https://www.sensetime.com/en), working with [Chen Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AerkT0YAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my PhD in the Department of Information Science, School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in virtual humans, human-centric 3d scene understanding, and human-centric embodiments.
