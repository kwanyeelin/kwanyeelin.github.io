Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

<!-- **About** -->

<!-- <p>Hey, thanks for stopping by! &#128516;</p> -->


I am a Research Fellow in the EECS department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, working with [Stella Yu](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~stellayu/). Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher in MMLab at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, working with [Xiaogang Wang](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/) and [Hongsheng Li](https://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/).  I was a Director of R&D at Intelligent Automotive Group of [SenseTime Group Inc.](https://www.sensetime.com/en/), working with [Chen Qian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/keninqc/). I received my PhD in the Department of Information Science, School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University.

  <h2>Research</h2>

  <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Vision, Computer Graphics, Robotics, and Machine Learning. My long-term goal is to build <strong>Realistic and Intelligent Virtual Humans</strong> -- embodied human-like systems that not only resemble humans,  but also emulate humans' remarkable cognitive and motor capabilities, enabling them to interact with the world with self-autonomy. I view and approach "Virtual Humans" from two complementary perspectives: (1) Virtual Avatars, which focus on digital representations of humans. (2) Humanoid Robots, which serve as the embodied carriers to connect perception to action in the physical world. My research has thus three themes:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Realistic Virtual Humans</strong>: Constructing high-fidelity 4D volumetric capture systems and datasets, as in <a href="https://dna-rendering.github.io/">DNA-Rendering</a> and <a href="https://renderme-360.github.io/">RenderMe-360</a>; modeling realistic human appearances and motions, as in <a href="https://yzmblog.github.io/projects/MonoHuman/">MonoHuman</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02431">GAR</a>, and <a href="https://timewalker2024.github.io/timewalker.github.io/">TimeWalker</a>; learning context-aware behaviour generation, as in <a href="publication/">EmbodiedHuman</a>; and developing human foundation models to obtain generic representations, as in <a href="https://cosmicman-cvpr2024.github.io/">CosmicMan</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>All-round Humanoid Robots</strong>: Building the synergistic relations of visual perception, proprioception, and action in embodied agents to develop integrative skills autonomously, as in <a href="https://lego-h-humanoidrobothiking.github.io/">LEGO-H</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Steerable And Realistic Scene Constrution</strong>: Developing realistic scene modeling and simulation frameworks, as a playground, to potentially enhance perception, navigation, and interaction in complex environments, as in <a href="https://dnmp.github.io/">UrbanRF (DNMP)</a>, <a href="https://urbanarchitect.github.io/">UrbanArchitect</a>, and <a href="https://slr-sfs.github.io/">SLR-SFS</a>.</li>
  </ul>

I am the Director of R&D at Intelligent Automotive Group of SenseTime Group Inc., working with [Chen Qian](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AerkT0YAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I lead the development and research of 3D Perceiving R&D Centre, which serves for several leading automakers (e.g., BMW, Honda and NIO) and has delivered 30+ mass-produced projects in the intelligent cabin industry.

I spent wonderful times as a post-doc researcher at [MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), with Prof. [Hongsheng Li](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~hsli/) and Prof. [Xiaogang Wang](http://www.ee.cuhk.edu.hk/~xgwang/). Previously, I received my PhD degree in the Department of Information Science, School of Mathematical Sciences at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/).

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics** and **XR**. I am particularly interested in 3d scene understanding, deep generative models, neural rendering and animation.
